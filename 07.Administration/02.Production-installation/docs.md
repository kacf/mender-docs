!!! You can save time by using [Hosted Mender](https://mender.io/signup?target=_blank); a secure Mender server ready to use, maintained by the Mender developers.

This is a step by step guide for deploying the Mender Server for production environments,
and will cover relevant security and reliability aspects of Mender production installations.
The Mender backend services can be deployed to production using a skeleton provided
in the `production` directory
of the [integration](https://github.com/mendersoftware/integration?target=_blank)
repository. Most of the steps are the same whether you are installing the Open Source or Enterprise edition of the Mender Server, but there are some extra steps that are covered in the [Enterprise subsection](enterprise).


## Prerequisites

- A machine with Ubuntu 18.04 (e.g. an instance from AWS EC2 or DigitalOcean) with the following tools installed:
  - git
  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/?target=_blank), version **17.03 or later**.
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/?target=_blank), version **1.6 or later**.
- Minimum of 10 GB free disk space and 4 GB RAM available for Mender and its services.
    - This heavily depends on your scale and environment, the supported [Mender Enterprise](https://mender.io/product/mender-enterprise) edition is recommended for larger-scale environments.
- A public IP address assigned and ports 443 and 9000 publicly accessible.
- Allocated DNS names for the Mender API Gateway and the Mender Storage Proxy
  (for purpose of the guide, it is assumed that you
  own the domains `mender.example.com` and `s3.example.com`) that resolve to the public
  IP of current host on the devices.

If you are setting up a Mender Enterprise server, you will also need:

- An account with Mender in order to evaluate and use the commercial features in
  Mender Enterprise. Please email [contact@mender.io](mailto:contact@mender.io)
  to receive your credentials to log in with docker below before proceeding.
- Docker configuration logged into the Mender Enterprise Docker registry:
  ```bash
  docker login -u=<USERNAME> docker.download.mender.io
  ```
  Replace `<USERNAME>` with the username from your Mender Enterprise
  account. This gives a prompt:
  > ```
  > Password: <TYPE PASSWORD HERE>
  > ```

!!! It is very likely possible to use other Linux distributions and versions. However, we recommend using this exact environment for running Mender because it is known to work and you will thus avoid any issues specific to your environment if you use this reference.

## Deployment steps

The guide will use a publicly available Mender integration repository. Then
proceed with setting up a local branch, preparing deployment configuration from
a template, committing the changes locally. Keeping deployment configuration in
a git repository ensures that the history of changes is tracked and subsequent
updates can be easily applied.

At the end of this guide you will have:

- production configuration in a single `docker-compose` file
- a running Mender backend cluster
- persistent service data is stored in Docker volumes:
  - artifact storage
  - MongoDB data
- SSL certificate for the API Gateway
- SSL certificate for the Storage Proxy
- a set of keys for generating and validating access tokens

Consult the section on [certificates and keys](../certificates-and-keys) for details on
how the certificates and keys are used in the system.

#### Docker compose naming scheme

`docker-compose` implements a particular naming scheme for containers, volumes
and networks that prefixes each object it creates with project name. By default,
the project is named after the directory the main compose file is located in.
The production configuration template provided in the repository explicitly sets
project name to `menderproduction`.

`docker-compose` automatically assigns a
`com.docker.compose.project=menderproduction` label to the created containers. The
label can be used when filtering output of commands such as `docker ps`.


### Basic preparation setup

Start off by cloning the Mender integration repository into a local directory
named `mender-server`:

<!--AUTOVERSION: "-b %"/integration -->
```bash
git clone -b master https://github.com/mendersoftware/integration mender-server
```

> ```
> Cloning into 'deployment'...
> remote: Counting objects: 1117, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (11/11), done.
> remote: Total 1117 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 1106
> Receiving objects: 100% (1117/1117), 233.85 KiB | 411.00 KiB/s, done.
> Resolving deltas: 100% (678/678), done.
> Checking connectivity... done.
> ```

Enter the directory:

```bash
cd mender-server
```

Prepare a branch where all deployment related changes will be kept:

```bash
git checkout -b my-production-setup
```

Enter the `production` directory:

```bash
cd production
```

Copy the production template to its own file:

```bash
cp config/prod.yml.template config/prod.yml
```

```
ls -l *
```

> ```
> -rwxr-xr-x 1 user user  725 Sep 17 14:14 run
>
> config:
> total 24
> -rw-r--r-- 1 user user  566 Sep 17 14:14 enterprise.yml.template
> -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 5814 Sep 10 15:44 prod.yml
> -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 5752 Sep 17 14:14 prod.yml.template
> ```

The template includes a few files:

- `run` - a convenience helper that invokes `docker-compose` by passing the required
  compose files; arguments passed to `run` in command line are forwarded
  directly to `docker-compose`

- `prod.yml` and `prod.yml.template` - contains deployment-specific
  configuration, builds on top of `docker-compose.yml` (located at the root of
  integration repository)

- `enterprise.yml.template` - configuration for running an Enterprise instance
  of the Mender server. This topic is covered separately in [the Enterprise
  part](enterprise) of the Production installation guide

!!! If an `enterprise.yml` file exists in the `config` directory, this will
!!! automatically turn on Enterprise features in the backend service. If you
!!! want to use the Open Source edition (not Enterprise), please remove
!!! `enterprise.yml` from the `config` directory.

At this point all changes should be committed to the repository:
<!--AUTOMATION: execute=sed -i '0,/set-my-alias-here.com/s/set-my-alias-here.com/s3.docker.mender.io/' config/prod.yml -->
<!--AUTOMATION: execute=sed -i 's|DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_URI:.*|DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_URI: https://s3.docker.mender.io:9000|' config/prod.yml -->

<!--AUTOMATION: ignore -->
```bash
git add .
```

<!--AUTOMATION: ignore -->
```bash
git commit -m 'production: initial template'
```
> ```
> [my-production-setup 556cc2e] production: initial template
>  1 file changed, 54 insertions(+)
>  create mode 100644 production/config/prod.yml
> ```

Assuming that current working directory is still `production`, download
necessary Docker images:

```bash
./run pull
```

> ```

> 3.4: Pulling from library/mongo
> Digest: sha256:aff0c497cff4f116583b99b21775a8844a17bcf5c69f7f3f6028013bf0d6c00c

! Using the `run` helper script may fail when local user has insufficient permissions to reach a local docker daemon. Make sure that the Docker installation was completed successfully and the user has sufficient permissions (typically the user must be a member of the `docker` group).

### Certificates and keys

Prepare certificates using the helper script `keygen` (replacing `mender.example.com`
and `s3.example.com` with your DNS names):

<!--AUTOMATION: ignore=use s3.docker.mender.io (localhost) instead-->
```bash
CERT_API_CN=mender.example.com CERT_STORAGE_CN=s3.example.com ../keygen
```
<!--AUTOMATION: execute=CERT_API_CN=s3.docker.mender.io CERT_STORAGE_CN=s3.docker.mender.io ../keygen -->

> ```
> Generating a 256 bit EC private key
> writing new private key to 'private.key'
> ...
> All keys and certificates have been generated in directory keys-generated.
> Please include them in your docker compose and device builds.
> For more information please see https://docs.mender.io/Administration/Certificates-and-keys.
> ```

Your local directory tree should now look like this:
<!--AUTOMATION: ignore -->
```bash
├── keys-generated
│   ├── certs
│   │   ├── api-gateway
│   │   │   ├── cert.crt
│   │   │   └── private.key
│   │   └── server.crt
│   │   └── storage-proxy
│   │       ├── cert.crt
│   │       └── private.key
│   └── keys
│       ├── deviceauth
│       │   └── private.key
│       └── useradm
│           └── private.key
├── config/enterprise.yml.template
├── config/prod.yml
├── config/prod.yml.template
└── run
```

The production template file `prod.yml` is already configured to load keys and
certificates from locations created by the `keygen` script. If you wish to use a
different set of certificates or keys, please consult the
[relevant documentation](../certificates-and-keys).

Next, we can add and commit generated keys and certificates:

! Note that the following steps will commit your keys in plaintext to the git history. Make sure to keep all keys secure. Use encryption if needed and decrypt the keys before using them in containers; see the section below on [encrypting keys](#encrypting-keys-optional) for some examples.

```bash
git add keys-generated
```

```bash
git commit -m 'production: adding generated keys and certificates'
```

> ```
> [my-production-setup fd8a397] production: adding generated keys and certificates
>  6 files changed, 108 insertions(+)
>  create mode 100644 production/keys-generated/certs/api-gateway/cert.crt

>  create mode 100644 production/keys-generated/keys/useradm/private.key
> ```

The API Gateway and Storage Proxy certificates generated here need to be made
available to the Mender client.
Consult the section on [building for production](../../artifacts/yocto-project/building-for-production)
for a description on how to include the certificates in the client builds.

!! Only certificates need to be made available to devices or end users. Private keys should never be shared.


#### Encrypting keys (optional)

A simple method for encrypting keys is to
use the [GNU Privacy Guard](https://www.gnupg.org/?target=_blank) tool. Instead of committing
plaintext keys to the repository, we will `tar` and encrypt the entire
`keys-generated` directory structure, then commit it to the repository as a
single binary blob.

The entire directory structure can be encrypted with the following command:

<!--AUTOMATION: ignore=optional step -->
```bash
tar c keys-generated |  gpg --output keys-generated.tar.gpg --symmetric
Enter passphrase:
```

<!--AUTOMATION: ignore=optional step -->
```
rm -rf keys-generated
```

<!--AUTOMATION: ignore=optional step -->
```
ls -l
```
> ```
> total 20
> drwxrwxr-x. 1 user group 4096 01-30 11:08 config
> -rw-rw-r--. 1 user group 5094 01-30 11:24 keys-generated.tar.gpg
> -rwxrwxr-x. 1 user group  173 01-27 14:16 run
> ```

Keys need to be decrypted before bringing the whole environment up:

<!--AUTOMATION: ignore=optional step -->
```bash
gpg --decrypt keys-generated.tar.gpg | tar xvf -
gpg: AES encrypted data
Enter passphrase:
```

When using encryption, commit `keys-generated.tar.gpg` instead of the
`keys-generated` directory structure to the repository, like this:

<!--AUTOMATION: ignore=optional step -->
```bash
git add keys-generated.tar.gpg
```

<!--AUTOMATION: ignore=optional step -->
```bash
git commit -m 'production: adding generated keys and certificates'
```

> ```
> [my-production-setup 237af44] production: adding generated keys and certificates
>  1 file changed, 111 insertions(+)
>  create mode 100644 production/keys-generated.tar.gpg
> ```


### Persistent storage

Persistent storage of backend services' data is implemented using
named [Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/?target=_blank).
The template is configured to mount the following volumes:

- `mender-artifacts` - artifact objects storage
- `mender-db` - mender services databases data
- `mender-elasticsearch-db` - elasticsearch service database data
- `mender-redis-db` - redis service database data

Each of these volumes need to be created manually with the following commands:

```bash
docker volume create --name=mender-artifacts
```

```bash
docker volume create --name=mender-db
```

```bash
docker volume create --name=mender-elasticsearch-db
```

```bash
docker volume create --name=mender-redis-db
```

Since we are using local driver for volumes, each volume is based on a host
local directory. It is possible to access files in this directory once a local path
is known. To find the local path for a specific volume run the following
command:

```bash
docker volume inspect --format '{{.Mountpoint}}' mender-artifacts
```
> ```
> /var/lib/docker/volumes/mender-artifacts/_data
> ```

The path depends on local docker configuration and may vary between installations.


### Configuration

The deployment configuration now needs to be edited. Open `config/prod.yml` in
your favorite editor.


#### Storage proxy

Locate the `storage-proxy` service and add `s3.example.com` (or your DNS name)
under `networks.mender.aliases` key. The entry should look like this:

```yaml
    ...
    storage-proxy:
        networks:
            mender:
                aliases:
                    - s3.example.com
    ...

```

You can also change the values for `DOWNLOAD_SPEED` and `MAX_CONNECTIONS`.
See the [section on bandwidth](../bandwidth) for more details on these
settings.


#### Minio

Locate the `minio` service. The keys `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY` control
credentials for uploading artifacts into the object store. Since Minio is a S3 API
compatible service, these settings correspond to Amazon's AWS Access Key ID and
Secret Access Key respectively.

Set `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` to `mender-deployments`. `MINIO_SECRET_KEY` should be set
to a value that can not easily be guessed. We recommend using the `pwgen` utility
for generating the secret. Run the following command to generate a 16-character long secret:

```bash
pwgen 16 1
```
> ```
> ahshagheeD1ooPae
> ```

The updated entry should look similar to this:

```yaml
    ...
    minio:
        environment:
            # access key
            MINIO_ACCESS_KEY: mender-deployments
            # secret
            MINIO_SECRET_KEY: ahshagheeD1ooPaeT8lut0Shaezeipoo
    ...

```
<!--AUTOMATION: execute=sed -i.bak 's/MINIO_ACCESS_KEY:.*/MINIO_ACCESS_KEY: Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F/' config/prod.yml -->
<!--AUTOMATION: execute=sed -i.bak 's/MINIO_SECRET_KEY:.*/MINIO_SECRET_KEY: abcssadasdssado798dsfjhkksd/' config/prod.yml -->

<!--AUTOMATION: execute=sed -i.bak 's/DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_AUTH_KEY:.*/DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_AUTH_KEY: Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F/' config/prod.yml -->
<!--AUTOMATION: execute=sed -i.bak 's/DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_AUTH_SECRET:.*/DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_AUTH_SECRET: abcssadasdssado798dsfjhkksd/' config/prod.yml -->


#### Deployments service

Locate the `mender-deployments` service. The deployments service will upload
artifact objects to `minio` storage via `storage-proxy`,
see the [administration overview](../overview) for more details. For this reason,
access credentials `DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_AUTH_KEY` and `DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_AUTH_SECRET`
need to be updated and `DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_URI` must point to `s3.example.com` (or
your DNS name).

!! The address used in `DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_URI` must be exactly the same as the one that will be used by devices. The deployments service generates signed URLs for accessing artifact storage. A different hostname or port will result in signature verification failure and download attempts will be rejected.

Set `DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_AUTH_KEY` and `DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_AUTH_SECRET` to the values
of `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY` respectively. Set
`DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_URI` to point to `https://s3.example.com:9000`.

The updated entry should look like this:

```yaml
    ...
    mender-deployments:
        ...
        environment:
            DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_AUTH_KEY: mender-deployments
            DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_AUTH_SECRET: ahshagheeD1ooPaeT8lut0Shaezeipoo
            DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_URI: https://s3.example.com:9000
    ...
```


#### API gateway

Locate the `mender-api-gateway` service. For security purposes, the gateway
must know precisely the DNS name allocated to it, which you'll configure via
the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` environment variable.

Change the placeholder value `my-gateway-dns-name` to a valid hostname; assuming it's
`mender.example.com`, the updated entry should look like this:

```yaml
    ...
    mender-api-gateway:
        ...
        environment:
            ALLOWED_HOSTS: mender.example.com
    ...
```

Note that if for some reason you need more than 1 DNS name pointing to the gateway,
you can supply a whitespace-separated list of hostnames as follows:

```yaml
    ...
    mender-api-gateway:
        ...
        environment:
            ALLOWED_HOSTS: mender1.example.com mender2.example.com
    ...
```


#### Device Authentication Service

Locate the `mender-device-auth` service.
Add the `environment` section if it is absent. In the `environment` section add the `DEVICEAUTH_MAX_DEVICES_LIMIT_DEFAULT` variable with an integer value. `0` represents `no limit` and is the default.
The updated entry should look like this:

```yaml
    ...
    mender-device-auth:
        ...
        environment:
            DEVICEAUTH_MAX_DEVICES_LIMIT_DEFAULT: 15
    ...
```


#### Logging

The setup uses Docker's default `json-file` logging driver, which exposes two important log
rotation parameters: `max-file` and `max-size`. For selected services - consistently producing
a large amount of logs - we override these settings to ensure that at any given time, logs capture
about 1 week of a running system's operation.

The reference setup used for determining these parameters (`max-file: 10`, `max-size: 50m`)
was 200 devices, polling the server every 30 minutes. The total log volume produced was 2.4GB,
and this is the recommended amount of disk space to reserve for logging purposes alone.

These parameters can however be adjusted accordingly to a particular deployment and workload. The
deciding factors determining the log volume are:
- the number of devices accessing the system.
- polling frequency

It is suggested to adjust log rotation parameters only after measuring the actual space usage for a given use case.

#### Saving the configuration

Once all the configuration is complete, commit all changes to the repository:

<!--AUTOMATION: ignore -->
```bash
git add config/prod.yml
```

<!--AUTOMATION: ignore -->
```bash
git commit -m 'production: configuration'
```

At this point your commit history should look as follows:

<!--AUTOVERSION: "git log --oneline origin/%..HEAD"/integration -->
<!--AUTOMATION: ignore -->
```bash
git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD
```
> ```
> 7a4de3c production: configuration
> 41273f7 production: adding generated keys and certificates
> 5ad6528 production: initial template
> ```


### Bring it all up

Bring up all services up in detached mode with the following command:

```bash
./run up -d
```
> ```
> Creating network "menderproduction_mender" with the default driver
> Creating menderproduction_mender-mongo_1
> Creating menderproduction_mender-gui_1
> Creating menderproduction_minio_1
> Creating menderproduction_mender-device-auth_1
> Creating menderproduction_mender-inventory_1
> Creating menderproduction_storage-proxy_1
> Creating menderproduction_mender-useradm_1
> Creating menderproduction_mender-deployments_1
> Creating menderproduction_mender-api-gateway_1
> ```

!!! Services, networks and volumes have a `menderproduction` prefix, see the note about [docker-compose naming scheme](#docker-compose-naming-scheme) for more details. When using `docker ..` commands, a complete container name must be provided (ex. `menderproduction_mender-deployments_1`).


### Creating the first user (Open Source only)

!!! If you are setting up an Enterprise server, please skip this step and
!!! proceed to [the Enterprise section](#enterprise), as the Enterprise server
!!! uses a different method for creating users.

Since this is a brand new installation we need to create the initial user via
the CLI provided by the User Administration Service. The service's binary is
embedded in a Docker container, so to execute it you will issue the **exec**
subcommand of docker-compose, e.g.:

<!--AUTOMATION: ignore -->
```bash
./run exec mender-useradm /usr/bin/useradm create-user --username=myusername@host.com --password=mysecretpassword
```

! Keep in mind that above is executed in a command-line interpreter meaning that certain characters might need to be escaped, e.g if you are using the `$` character in your password, this could interpret as a variable name unless it is escaped.

The next sections deal with installation of an Enterprise server. If you are
installing an Open Source server, please proceed to
[verification](#verification) now.


## Enterprise

This section will go through setting up the Enterprise features of the Mender
server. If you are using the Open Source edition of the Mender server, you can
skip ahead to [the verification](#verification).


### Configuring Enterprise

Once the Open Source parts of the configuration have been completed, you should
have a fully functional server setup, except that it has not been launched
yet. It is now time to configure the Enterprise specific features before
bringing the server up.

1. Shut down the services.
   ```
   ./run stop
   ```

2. Copy the `enterprise.yml.template` file to its production location,
   `enterprise.yml`:
   ```
   cp config/enterprise.yml.template config/enterprise.yml
   ```
   Creating the `enterprise.yml` file enables the Enterprise Mender server.

3. Start the services again.
   ```bash
   ./run up
   ```
> ```
> Starting menderproduction_mender-api-gateway_1 ... done
> Starting menderproduction_mender-conductor_1 ... done
> Starting menderproduction_mender-deployments_1 ... done
> Starting menderproduction_mender-device-auth_1 ... done
> Starting menderproduction_mender-elasticsearch_1 ... done
> Creating menderproduction_mender-email-sender_1 ... done
> Starting menderproduction_mender-gui_1 ... done
> Starting menderproduction_mender-inventory_1 ... done
> Starting menderproduction_mender-mongo_1 ... done
> Creating menderproduction_mender-org-welcome-email-preparer_1 ... done
> Starting menderproduction_mender-redis_1 ... done
> Creating menderproduction_mender-tenantadm_1 ... done
> Starting menderproduction_mender-useradm_1 ... done
> Starting menderproduction_minio_1 ... done
> Starting menderproduction_storage-proxy_1 ... done
> ```

Note that even though this launches the Enterprise backend services, the Mender
Enterprise server is not fully functional yet.

### Multi tenancy

Multi tenancy is a feature of Mender where users can be divided into
"organizations" (also sometimes called "tenants"). Each organization is confined
and can not see or influence the data of other organizations. This can be used
for example to give two different product teams access to the Mender service,
without them seeing each others data, as well as isolating devices and users in
test and production environments.

When using Mender Enterprise, multi tenancy is automatically enabled, and it
cannot be turned off. However, since multi tenancy is not desirable in all
situations, a default organization can be specified, which makes using this one
organization transparent. Use this approach if you do not plan to create
multiple organizations and see the section on [using a default
organization](#option-1-using-a-default-organization) for more information.

Below follows a guide for setting up a single organization. For additional
information on administering organizations, see the [API for the tenantadm
service (TODO!)](TODO), as well as the help screen from:

```bash
./run exec mender-tenantadm /usr/bin/tenantadm --help
```

#### Creating the first organization and user

In either case, at least one organization must be created when first installing
the service. Execute this command in the `integration/production` directory:

```bash
./run exec mender-tenantadm /usr/bin/tenantadm create-org --name=MyOrganization --username=myusername@host.com --password=mysecretpassword
```

Replace the organization name, username and password with desired values. Make
sure to save the **tenant ID** that appears after calling the command; this will
be the identifier for the first organization. Creating additional organizations
works exactly the same way, so the above step may be repeated multiple times.

Now we need to fetch the **tenant token** for the new organization. This is
available in the JSON output from the `get-tenant` command, in the
`tenant_token` field. To avoid manually parsing raw JSON, we can use the `jq`
tool:

```bash
./run exec mender-tenantadm /usr/bin/tenantadm get-tenant --id $TENANT_ID | jq -r .tenant_token
```

where `$TENANT_ID` is the ID that was printed by the previous command. The
resulting tenant token will be a long string like this:

!!! On Debian based distributions you can install `jq` with the command `apt-get
!!! install jq`.

Make sure that the string does not include any spaces or newlines when you copy
it from the terminal. The tenant token will be used in the following sections.

#### Choosing organization configuration

An organization configuration must be chosen before the server is fully
functional, and there are two configurations to choose from:

1. Default organization configuration
2. Tenant token configuration

By specifying a default organization, devices will be able to register with the
specified default organization, without a tenant token. With a tenant token
configuration, each device needs a **tenant token** which enables it to register
in that organization's account.

The general recommendation is to use option number 2, tenant token
configuration. However, option 1, default organization configuration, is
sometimes more appropriate, and there are usually two reasons to use this:

* You are upgrading from the Open Source version of Mender
* You don't need multiple organizations and wish to use only one, and you don't
  wish to provide a tenant token in the device configuration.

**Note:** Even when only one organization is going to be used, the
recommendation is to use the tenant token configuration. This ensures a smooth
upgrade path if you later decide to use multiple organizations. It also gives a
small security benefit, by completely blocking devices that don't have a tenant
token.

#### Option 1: Using a default organization

If you are not going to use a default organization, you can skip this section
and proceed to the section on [using a tenant
token](#option-2-using-a-tenant-token).

To specify a default organization:

1. Stop the services by calling `./run down`

2. In `config/enterprise.yml`, locate the `DEVICEAUTH_DEFAULT_TENANT_TOKEN`
   variable, and make sure its value is set to the **tenant token** that was
   fetched in the previous section

3. Start the services again with `./run up -d`

#### Option 2: Using a tenant token

If you configured a default organization above, then this section can be skipped
unless you want more organizations in addition to the default one.

First, make sure you have fetched the tenant token as described
[earlier](#creating-the-first-organization-and-user). You can repeat the steps
for multiple organizations if you need to. The **tenant token** needs to be
included in the client configuration of each device that is going to be managed
by Mender. Exactly how to include the token depends on which integration method
is used with the client. Please refer to one of these sections:

* [Mender installed on device using a deb
  package](../../client-configuration/installing#configuration-for-hosted-mender-server)
* [Device integration using Yocto
  Project](../../artifacts/yocto-project/variables#mender_tenant_token)
* [Device integration with Debian
  Family](../../artifacts/debian-family#convert-a-raw-disk-image)
* [Modifying an existing prebuilt
  image](../../artifacts/modifying-a-mender-artifact#changing-the-mender-server)

No further configuration is needed on the server to use a tenant token on the
clients.


### Saving the Enterprise configuration

Once the Enterprise configuration is complete, commit all changes to the
repository:

<!--AUTOMATION: ignore -->
```bash
git add config/enterprise.yml
```

<!--AUTOMATION: ignore -->
```bash
git commit -m 'production: Enterprise configuration'
```

At this point your commit history should look as follows:

<!--AUTOVERSION: "git log --oneline origin/%..HEAD"/integration -->
<!--AUTOMATION: ignore -->
```bash
git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD
```
> ```
> 76b3d00 production: Enterprise configuration
> 7a4de3c production: configuration
> 41273f7 production: adding generated keys and certificates
> 5ad6528 production: initial template
> ```


## Verification

<!-- TODO! Need to fix the testing here -->

<!--AUTOMATION: test=for ((n=0;n<5;n++)); do sleep 3 && test "$(docker ps | grep menderproduction | grep -c -i 'up')" = 12 || ( echo "some containers are not 'Up'" && exit 1 ); done -->
<!--AUTOMATION: test=./run restart -->
<!--AUTOMATION: test=for ((n=0;n<5;n++)); do sleep 3 && test "$(docker ps | grep menderproduction | grep -c -i 'up')" = 12 || ( echo "some containers are not 'Up'" && exit 1 ); done -->
<!--AUTOMATION: test=docker ps | grep menderproduction | grep "0.0.0.0:443" -->
<!--AUTOMATION: test=docker ps | grep menderproduction | grep "0.0.0.0:9000" -->

To verify that the services are running, execute the following command and
verify that the state of all services is "Up":

```bash
./run ps
```

Below you can see typical output for the Enterprise server. The Open Source
server will be similar, but will have fewer services running.

At this point you can try to log into the Web UI using the URL of your server,
and the username and password that was [created
earlier](#creating-the-first-organization-and-user).

!! It is advised to use the UI to change the password of all users that were
!! added in this guide, since the shell may keep a record of the password in
!! plaintext.

If you encounter any issues while starting or running your Mender Server, you
can take a look at the section for [troubleshooting Mender
Server](../../../troubleshooting/mender-server).
